Choosing a filter</A>
</H1>

<P>
In this screen you will be asked to choose a filter of certain type,
and specify the necessary parameters. When a filter type is chosen
from a drop-down list, only fields that are relevant for its parameter
specification are shown.

<P>
These are the filter types that have been implemented:

<UL>
<LI><B>EKF:</B> Extended Kalman Filter. Parameters needed: Initial
distribution of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>, and the
Jacobians <!-- MATH
 $\partial f / \partial x$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$ \partial$"><I>f</I> /<IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$ \partial$"><I>x</I></SPAN> and <!-- MATH
 $\partial h / \partial
x$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$ \partial$"><I>h</I>/<IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$ \partial$"><I>x</I></SPAN>. These functions are specified either by a script name or as an anonymous
function. 
</LI>
<LI><B>PF - Simple: </B> Particles propagate according to the state
transition equation. Parameters needed: number of particles,
resampling period, resampling algorithm, initial distribution of the
particles. 
</LI>
<LI><B>PF - EKF: </B> Particles propagate according to a proposal
distribution. The proposal is obtained through an EKF-like procedure
which takes into account the current observation. Parameters needed in
addtion to those for <TT>PF - Simple</TT>: the Jacobian <!-- MATH
 $\partial h /
\partial x$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$ \partial$"><I>h</I>/<IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$ \partial$"><I>x</I></SPAN>. Note that unlike in EKF, the Jacobian <!-- MATH
 $\partial f /
\partial x$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$ \partial$"><I>f</I> /<IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$ \partial$"><I>x</I></SPAN> is not needed, since the proposal is <EM>conditioned on</EM>
the previous value of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>, as opposed to <EM>propagated from</EM> the
previous Gaussian approximation. 
</LI>
<LI><B>PF - Regularized: </B> Roughtly speaking, in representing the
filtered density, the delta function at each particle
location is replaced by a continuous kernel function. Parameters
needed in addition to those for <TT>PF - Simple</TT> are: 

<UL>
<LI>type: when regularization is performed. For details, see Project
Report.
</LI>
<LI>whitening: whether to perform whitening on the particles. For
details, see Project Report.
</LI>
<LI>width: kernel width, whose ``optimal'' value (as a function of
state dimension and number of particles) is filled into the edit box
by <TT>PFWiz</TT>. It can be changed by a user.  For details, see Project
Report.
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI><B>PF - Auxilliary Variable: </B> Roughly speaking, this filter
approximates, using local Monte Carlo method, the ``optimal'' proposal
density that cannot be directly sampled from. Resampling is
automatically achieved in this implementation. Parameters needed:
Number of particles and their initial distribution. 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The following resampling schemes are available:

<UL>
<LI><B>none:</B> No resampling.
</LI>
<LI><B>simple:</B> Resampling is performed using the weights.
</LI>
<LI><B>residual: </B> Resampling is performed using the residual of
the weights, after the ``bulk part'' has been deterministically
chosen. 
</LI>
<LI><B>systematic: </B> Only one random number is drawn, and
resampling is achieved by a set of points that are equally spaced from
this random number. 
</LI>
<LI><B>branch-kill: </B> The resampling of each particle is
independent, therefore the total number of particles is not fixed. An
additional parameter, <TT>branch-kill threshold</TT>, needs to be
specified: When the total number of particles drops below this
percentage, a simple resampling is performed to bring it back to  the
initially chosen value.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Resampling can be performed every <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN> step, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN> is specified in
the <TT>resampling period</TT> box.

<P>
As in the previous screen, the <TT>Show code</TT> button does error checking
and presents the code in an editor window. If the button <TT>Done</TT> is
clicked, a confirmation window pops up to confirm the closing of <TT>PFWiz</TT>. The editor window will remain open showing the code
generated.
