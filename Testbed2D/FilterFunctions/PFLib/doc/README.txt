This directory contains all the functions and classes of PFLib, a MATLAB toolbox for Particle Filters.

The simplest way to use PFLib is to run the GUI pfwiz.m. It will gather input from you and automatically generate code. You can study that code and cut-and-paste it into other simulation scripts.

More documentation is being prepared.
